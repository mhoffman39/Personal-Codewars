// Your task is to write the code that would take an unordered array of inputs, and find the shortest common subsequence.

// e.g.

// Input:
// ['shor', 'hort',  'rtes', 'test']
// Output:
// 'shortest'


function shortestCommonSupersequence(sequences) {
  //I - an array of string segments
  //O - a string that is comprised of the string segments
  //C -
  //E -

  //create a variable with the first array element to start out

  //iterate over input starting with index 1
    //if
}
